#sup_sis

Sup Sis is a micro-blog for family members to keep up with each other.  As I've moved 3000 miles away from everyone I know, I'm missing so many stories and updates from my sisters, my brother, and my parents.  I want my family to post updates, add pictures, link to new finds, and stay connected with each other.  And most importantly, with me!
