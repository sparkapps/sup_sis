# 'sup Sis!

### Sup Sis is a micro-blog for family members to keep up with each other.  As I've moved 3,000 miles away from everyone I know, I'm missing so many stories and updates from my sisters, my brother, and my parents.  With 'sup Sis, my family can post updates, add pictures, link to new finds, and stay connected with each other.  And most importantly, with me!
